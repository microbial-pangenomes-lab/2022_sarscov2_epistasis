This pipeline is able to run spydrpick algoritm on a very big dataset represented by a GISAID full alignment of SARS-CoV2 
sequences from late 2019 to June 2022. The pipeline is made by several steps implemented in different python scripts.
The analysis is made in 2 configurations: 
- On the total dataset (> 4 milion sequences)
- On 27 month labelled subsets (1000 randomly chosen sequences for each month), 
  providing a time-scale analysis of the epistatic interactions in SARS-COV2.

In this version the mmseqs2 sequence clustering is replaced by a more consistent double weighting based on:
1. Time: SNPs which are found in older sequences (we assigned each sequence to months bins) will have a lower weight compared
   to recent found SNPs, following a exponential decay equation (@ ref to manuscript)
2. Tree distance: We used GISAID provided tree to calculate the distances of each sequence (leaf) from the root, and weight
   the leaves proportionally.

Scripts used for this analysis:
- public_seqs_filter.py : Extract the public sequences from the GISAID total multialignment
- make_pos.py : list only the relevant positions in which the analysis will be computed. According to reference gene
- prefilter.py : extract only the sequences of the multialignment that are present in the GISAID tree (higher quality)
- filter_single.py : deduplicate sequences of the filtered multialignment and converts it into a numpy matrix for next
  computations.
- spydrpick_alt.py : run spydrpick on all positions
- spydrpick_tukey.py : find tukey outliers 
- spydrpick_filter.py : Use ARACNE algoritm to filter out indirect interactions
- calc_distances.py : compute distance between positions and add to final table/output
